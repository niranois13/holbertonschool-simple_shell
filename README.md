The Simple Shell is a simple command line interpreter based on the first Unix shell 'sh', created by Ken Thompson in 1971. The Ghost in the Shell is a minimalistic and contains functionality for only the most basic shell tasks - accepting input, parsing the input into a command and its arguments, and executing that input.

## Purpose

The purpose of the simple shell project is to understand:

- How a shell works
- PID and PPIDs
- How processes are created
- How to manipulate the environment of the current process
- The difference between a function and a system call
- What are the three prototypes of main
- How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
- How to execute another program with the execve system call
- How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
- What is EOF / “end-of-file”?
## Requirements 

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Betty will be proud
- Your shell should not have any memory leaks
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- Use system calls only when you need to (why?)
## output
 
 - Our program must have the exact same output as :   'sh (/bin/sh) ' as well as the exact same error output.
